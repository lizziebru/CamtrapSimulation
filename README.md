# **Travel speed manuscript data and plots** 

This directory contains the data generated by the simulation and used for the analysis, and the plots made for the manuscript.

All code and data used in model parameterization can be found in my CamtrapSimulation repository forked from Marcus' original one: https://github.com/lizziebru/CamtrapSimulation.

## **simulation_data**

Pipeline divided into 3:
1. generate animal movement paths --> data outputs in the Paths folder
2. overlay movement paths with the camera trap --> data outputs in the Sequence data and plotting variables folder in the seq_dats subfolders
3. estimate travel speed from the camera trap data --> data outputs in the Sequence and plotting variables folder in the plotting_variables subfolders

### **Paths**

Two folders containing paths with and without simulation of alternative movement behaviours. Both contain 10 sub-folders for the 10 different body masses (Mb1 corresponds to 1kg body mass, etc.), with each on of these folders containing 20 iterations and a plot of the first iteration.

**unimodal_paths**

Paths without explicit simulation of alternative movement behaviours. Generated on 08Jul22.

**bimodal_paths**

Paths with explicit simulation of alternative movement behaviours. Generated on 27Jul22.

This script calls the pipeline_cluster_path.R script on the cluster to run the simulation of animal movement paths.

[**pipeline_local_seqdats.R**](code/pipeline_local_seqdats.R)

This script runs the simulation of camera trap detection of animal movement on pre-generated paths, outputting sequence data storing the coordinates of detected points, their speeds, and combining detections at multiple points within one crossing of the detection zone into sequences. Also stores plots of the the first simulation run in the same folder as the paths.

[**pipeline_local_analysis.R**](code/pipeline_local_analysis.R)

This script analyses results from the simulation run in the two above scripts, outputting summary plots showing the biases in the camera trap detection process and subsequent average speed estimation.

[**dz_dimensions_modelling.R**](code/dz_dimensions_modelling.R)

This script contains all modelling work on the probabilistic detection processes of camera traps, notably relating to body mass scaling. Uses data previously collected in Panama, Regent's Park, and India (see Data folder for more information).

[**path_modelling.R**](code/path_modelling.R)

This script contains all the modelling work to simulate animal movement paths, including unimodal versus bimodal movement with body mass scaling work. Uses data previously collected in Panama, Regent's Park, India, and Spain.

[**fit_norm_dist.Rmd**](code/fit_norm_dist.Rmd)

Script written by Francis Windram to explain his thoughts on using a coefficient of variation to scale standard deviation with speed. Didn't end up using in the final simulation because data suggest no body mass scaling of speed standard deviation.

[**rename_path_results.sh**](code/rename_path_results.sh)

This script renames and stores path results generated by the cluster.

[**extra_funcs_CamtrapSimmulation.R**](code/extra_funcs_CamtrapSimulation.R)

This script contains extra functions previously used in the main CamtrapSimulation but not currently needed. May be useful again in future.

[**lizzie_triangle_vectors.Rmd**](code/lizzie_triangle_vectors.Rmd)

Script written by Francis Windram for some initial exploration of working out the distribution of the distances of all possible straight-line paths across a triangle. Not used in analysis for the manuscript but may be useful in future.

[**plotting_final.R**](code/plotting_final.R)

Script for making plots for the write-up and manuscript. Uses the simulation data available on OneDrive: https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/eab21_ic_ac_uk/Documents/Travel%20speed%20manuscript?csf=1&web=1&e=IkxxXa.

### **Sequence data and plotting variables**

Two folders (one for paths with and one for paths without simulation of alternative movement behaviours) containing the results of overlaying the paths above with the camera trap.

Seq_dats corresponds to the camera trap data - contains position data and speeds of sampled sequences. Separate .RData file provided for each iteration of each body mass.

Plotting variables are generated from seq_dats - they contain all the estimates of travel speeds using different methods (gamma, Weibull etc.) and mean observed speeds, mean realised speeds etc.


**unimodal_seqdats**

Without alternative movement behaviours.

**bimodal_seqdats**

With alternative movement behaviours. Separate folders provided for each different proportion of fast/slow behaviours (mov0.1 corresponds to 10% fast behaviour, 90% slow behaviour).
