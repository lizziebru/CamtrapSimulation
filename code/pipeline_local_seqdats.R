## PIPELINE for local use - once paths have been generated by the HPC ##
# runs the simulation using the pre-generated paths from the path_results folder
# stores plot of the first simulation run in the same folder as the pathS

## TO DO: CHANGE NAME OF OUTPUT FILE SO THAT IT'S THE EXPONENTIAL OF THE SPEED PARAMETER
