## Bits to add to write-up when have wifi

when talking about percentage singles & zeros: important to divide by total no. of detected points bc have taken scaling of hz into account when calculating them (i.e. count of singles & zeros is defined by the detection probability of that point (rather than just 1) so that it makes an adequate comparison with no. of detected points)

git update of camtrapsimulation + pipeline_local_analysis:
- finish parallising generate_plotting_variables
- general tidy-up of CamtrapSimulation.R - sorting comments and getting rid of unneeded functions
- incl making extra script where put functions not currently used but might be useful in future
