	\section{Introduction}
	
	in intro and discussion: 
	- include how understanding biases in CT data/info is useful to help us better combine it with telemetry/accelerometry data to get the best info using multiple methods complementarily
	-- could maybe test this after the project using my stuff on Rory Wilson's data 
	
	--> additional potential collaboration with Rory Wilson:
	- he has a measure he developed - ODBA - to do with speed & tortuosity - from accelerometry data (they're coming up with much more real-life data using GPS & accelerometry data together)- v simple formula
	- measures cost of movement
	- could apply ODBA to simulation to think about costs of movement
	- useful to see if could use this model to give insights into the costs of movement & to see why these distributions look the way they do - i.e. could use the model to explain relationships in evo sense
	- e.g. what combos are most likely in nature? which are the CTs getting?
	--> keep as a side project - could maybe add in at the end as a nice biology bit
	
	
	fleshing out biases is important to warn ppl & make suggestions e.g. maybe better to combine CTs
	
	fine-scale analysis of speed & tortuosity = hard to come by so this stuff is super important
